    <section>
        <p>"Skin Care for You" introduces the concept of personalized skincare, emphasizing that an effective routine begins with understanding your unique skin type (oily, dry, combo, sensitive) and creating a personalized plan to address your specific needs and concerns. This approach involves a consistent, simple routine including cleansing, moisturizing, and sun protection, along with targeted treatments like serums, while always remembering to be patient and avoid mixing too many new products at once. </p>

    <h2>Protection</h2>
    <p> Protection in skincare primarily means shielding the skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, environmental pollutants, and maintaining a healthy skin barrier. The key methods include daily application of broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher), wearing protective clothing, seeking shade during peak sun hours, and using products with ingredients like ceramides to support the skin's natural barrier.</p>
